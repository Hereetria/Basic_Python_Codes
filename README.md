# 🐍 Simple Python Prototypes • Learning Series • (Archived)

## 📌 Project Overview
A collection of three simple Python projects developed during my early learning phase.  
These were the **first codes I wrote** after starting software development, focusing on basic input/output, control structures, and standard library usage.  
> 📦 Archived — This project is no longer being updated. It’s kept as part of my learning history and serves as a technical reference for future projects.
